GAME OF DRAWS
=============

How the game works
------------------

* Game consist of a regular deck of playing cards with 4 suite and 13 cards in each suite.

* The game is played with two or more players. Each player is dealt with equal numbers of cards so if there are two players then each player will have 26 cards. if there are 3 players then card distribution would be 18 17 and 17.

* Players would not be able to see the cards they are dealt. The cards will be hold by each player with the whole stack dealt to that player facing down.

* The game starts with the first player playing the card in the playing area, followed by second player and so on.

* when a player plays a card in the playing area he has a chance to win the deck of cards in the playing area if:
	** The suite of the card he played matches the suite of the last card played in the playing area.
	** The value of the card he played matches the value of the last card played in the playing area.

* When a player wins a deck of card, the winning deck needs to be placed below his existing deck face down.

* When a player has no more cards to play he looses.

* Last player who has cards left wins.
